# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results 

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:
- Implement the new webpage, 
- Keep the old webpage, or 
- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The notebook is divided into the following sections:
- Introduction
- Part I - Probability
- Part II - A/B Test
- Part III - Regression
- Final Check
- Submission

Specific programming tasks are marked with a **ToDo** tag. 

`Note:` The detailed explaination of each section is present in the notebook.

# Conclusion
Based on the results summary we found from all the approaches:
- The null hypotheses was failed to be rejected.
- The explanatory variables are not statistically significant for predicting the conversion rate.
- Hence, we need more evidence/variables to get better quality predicitions.
- Lastly, I would suggest to keep the old page.
